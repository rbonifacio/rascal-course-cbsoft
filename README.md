# Program Analysis and Manipulation Using Rascal

This is the repository of a short couse on program analysis and manipulation using Rascal. We taught this course the first time at CBSoft 2019.

You can find the slides [here](intro-rascal/slides.pdf)

## Sample Code

   * ColoredTree: explores some Rascal constructs using tree manipulation
   * SYB: explores how to scrap your boilerplate with Rascal
   * FSM: explores concepts like syntax definition and parsing using Rascal
