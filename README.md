# Program Analysis and Manipulation Using Rascal

This is the repository of a short couse on program analysis and manipulation using Rascal. We taught this course the first time at [CBSoft 2019](https://cbsoft2019.ufba.br/#/cbsoft).

You can find the slides [here](intro-rascal/slides.pdf)

## Sample Code

   * [CTrees](intro-rascal/code/rascal/ColoredTree): explores some Rascal constructs using tree manipulation
   * [SYB](intro-rascal/code/rascal/101Companies): explores how to scrap your boilerplate with Rascal. A Haskell version is also [available](intro-rascal/code/haskell/)
   * [FSM](intro-rascal/code/rascal/FSM): explores concepts like syntax definition and parsing using Rascal

## External Projects

   * RJTL library: a Rascal library for rejuvenating Java code
   * SpongeBugs: a Rascal library for repairing issues from SonarQube
